We study and work endless hours to pursue our dreams and aspirations in this lifetime and it’s up to us on how we want the world to see us at the end of the day.
        If we work on ourselves and push through the bounds and limits of our physical body, we might just find what we are looking for in life, we can travel out of our comfort zone and see how the rest of the world are living and meet new and interesting people. <br /><br />

        How we behave and work defines our reality within our mind, it shapes our very own existence and progression into later years of life. We are faced with various challenges and obstacles along the way, which will serve as a test to pure grit and determination. It’s interesting to see how we are rewarded more for certain sets of behaviour as opposed to other things we might do, depending on the economic activity involved.<br /><br />

        We all have to make decisions based around what we want in life and what we’re willing to do in order to get what we want. It takes some level of imagination and curiosity to explore and find out why we’re existing on this planet. We exist to do, act, behave and imagine the endless possibilities of what ventures we will carry out whilst living this life. 

        We explore all the local possibilities till they’re all exhausted, then we venture off into another part of our mind and do some more creative exploration. We dive head first into the rough sea and embark on our first long distance swim to test our endurance and level of fitness.
        We all have to begin somewhere, but you may be surprised where you end up next.
